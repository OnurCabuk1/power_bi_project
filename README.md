# 🏨 Hotel Data Analysis Project

## 📊 About the Project
This project contains information about two hotels owned by a company. The dataset includes customer counts, room types, repeat guest status, hotel types (resort & city), reservation counts, cancellation counts, weighted guest counts by years and months, guest demographics (adults, children, infants), total revenue, and meal plans (bed & breakfast, half board, all-inclusive, etc.), as well as the countries from which guests arrive.

## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1. 📥 Data Examination
I began by thoroughly examining the hotel dataset to understand its structure and the relationships between different variables.

### 2. ⚙️ Measures and Calculations
In Power BI, I utilized measures to make necessary adjustments in relevant areas. I performed calculations to analyze the data effectively.

### 3. 📈 Data Visualization
I created tables and visualizations in Power BI, resulting in a comprehensive dashboard consisting of four pages: **Overview**, **Hotel**, **Guest**, and **Reservation**. Additionally, I added tooltips for better insights.

## 📁 Content
- **Hotel Dataset**: The dataset containing detailed information about the two hotels.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: The Power BI file showcasing the visualizations and analyses performed.

## 📄 Files
- **`hotel_data_analysis.pbix`**: The Power BI file containing the complete analysis and dashboard visualizations.

## 🚀 Usage
1. You can open the Power BI file (`hotel_data_analysis.pbix`) to review the analysis and visualizations.
2. Make sure you have Power BI Desktop installed to view and interact with the dashboard.

## 💬 Note
